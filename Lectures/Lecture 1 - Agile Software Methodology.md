## 1. Introduction to Agile Software Development

### 1.1 Definition of Agile
- Agile is a software development approach focused on iterative progress, collaboration, and adaptability.
- Emphasizes delivering small, functional increments over time.

### 1.2 Core Principles
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

### 1.3 Agile vs. Traditional Development
- **Traditional (Waterfall):** Sequential, rigid phases (e.g., design -> development -> testing).
- **Agile:** Iterative cycles (sprints), flexible and adaptive to changing requirements.

## 2. Agile Frameworks

### 2.1 Scrum
- Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.
- Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.

### 2.2 Kanban
- Visual workflow management (Kanban board).
- Focus on continuous delivery and limiting work in progress (WIP).

### 2.3 Extreme Programming (XP)
- Practices: Pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), frequent releases.
- High emphasis on technical excellence and customer satisfaction.

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 What are User Stories?
- Simple, informal descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of an end-user.
- Focus on user needs rather than technical details.

### 3.2 Anatomy of a User Story
- Format: "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."
  - Example: "As a customer, I want to filter products by price so that I can find affordable options."
- Components:
  - **Role:** Who is the user?
  - **Goal:** What does the user want to achieve?
  - **Benefit:** Why is this important to the user?

### 3.3 Writing Effective User Stories
- **INVEST Criteria:**
  - Independent
  - Negotiable
  - Valuable
  - Estimable
  - Small
  - Testable
- Use plain, simple language to ensure clarity.

### 3.4 User Stories vs. Requirements
- **User Stories:** Focused on user needs and outcomes.
- **Requirements:** Detailed, often technical, specifications.

## 4. Practical Applications

### 4.1 Using User Stories in Scrum
- User stories are added to the Product Backlog.
- Selected and refined during Sprint Planning.
- Delivered and reviewed during the Sprint.

### 4.2 Prioritizing User Stories
- Use prioritization techniques such as:
  - MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Wonâ€™t Have).
  - Value vs. Effort matrix.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to determine priorities.

### 4.3 Common Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Vague or incomplete user stories.
  - **Solution:** Conduct story refinement sessions and involve stakeholders.
- **Challenge:** Overloaded sprints.
  - **Solution:** Properly size and estimate stories using tools like story points.
